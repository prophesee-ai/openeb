    The builder is meant to evolve to be able to manage future use cases:
    * builder will, for the board having the required serial, build a TzDevice for every device plugged on the board.
    * TzDevice derivated classes will implement, when necessary, the init/start/stop/destroy (ISSD) sequencies for the
      device, and spawn the facilities as defined by Metavision HAL.
    * As the TzDevice need to give a reference of itself to the facilities, and the lifetime of objects is managed
      using shared pointers, the constructor is protected, and the construction is done through a static method.
    * The order of device build may be important as some devices depend on others for power or clock. Today, it is
      assumed that building it treuzell index order is fine, but, if needed, commands may be added in Treuzell to
      describe chaining. The builder shall build device in appropriate order. At some point, some devices may choose
      how to build others, it is not implemented yet, but suggested implementation, if needed, would be to add a
      specific interface to devices requiring this, and detect it through runtine type information (rtti)
    * The builder will also spawn the device control and propagate start/stop as needed. The propagation mechanism will
      be strictly internal, and can be rewritten to manage multiple successors if needed at some point in the future.
